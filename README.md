# Web-Socket-implement-Java-Tomcat-7

I just got a solution to implement this with java; whereas I faced with handshake error 404 many times.

# How to install

1. Run with apache-tomcat-7.0.65 and javax.websocket-api-1.0.jar

2. Make sure that jar lib is in WebContent folder not in lib folder.

NOTE: My experience, I have used tomcat 7.0.12, so it produced failed result with handshake 404.
